# Car-Count-system-in-parking-lot-using-FPGA--
Designed and implemented an FPGA-based system to count the number of cars in a parking lot. Implemented logic to increment or decrement the car count based on the input from the sensors and debounce the generated pulses from two push buttons on FPGA (i.e pressure senors) Generated a 4-bit signal "CarCount" as the output.
